This module is an optional part of the Ubercart module and exists to
integrate Ubercart functions with CiviCRM.

To install this module, copy the uc_civicrm directory and its contents
to the ubercart/contrib directory, then visit the admin/build/modules
page and enable the Ubercart-CiviCRM Integration module in the
Ubercart - extra section.

When a customer buys something from the Ubercart store, the name and
address information they provide is added to the CiviCRM contact
database. If the customer has a simple contact record generated by
synching CiviCRM from the Drupal user table, that record is updated
with the new information. If no contact record exists, one is
created. 

Then the new or updated contact is added to the 'Purchasers' group,
which is created if necessary. An activity history record of type
'Purchase' is added to the contact's history, and the 'Purchases' tab
on the contact's dashboard entry is populated with a link to the
contact's order history in Ubercart.

File tests/uc_civicrm.test contains a unit test for uc_civicrm.module
which is designed to run under Drupal simpletest 6.x-1.2.
